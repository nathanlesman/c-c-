Piping and redirection are concepts that allows the user to control the flow of data between programs and files, the concepts are for unix like operating systems

Redirection (<, >, >>)
this concept is used to change the default input/output of a program 
> : redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten
>> : appends the standard output to the end of a file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created 
< : redirects the standard input of a command to come from a file instead of the keyboard

the example:
program < in > out

< in : The program reads its input from the file instead of the standard input
> out : The program writes its output to the file "out" instead of the standard output

So the program takes the content of the file "in" as its input and writes the result to the file "out"

Piping (|) is a mechanism that allows the output of one command to be used as the input to another command. This is done using the pipe operator. Piping connects the standard output of one command directly yo the standard input of another 

So program | less means: the output of program is used as the input of less, the output of program is not printed to the terminal, but is indeed used as input to the less command. Less is a pager program that allows the user to view large amounts of text on one screen at a time
