An object file is an intermediate file generated by the compiler that contains machine code translated from a source code file, but it is not executbale yet. 

With the object file you can split a larger program into smaller and more manageable parts, that can be compiled seperately. They also facilitate code reuse.

The executable contains machine code ready to be run by the computers os. The executable is the finalrunnable version of the program that users can execute to see the program's intended behavior.
