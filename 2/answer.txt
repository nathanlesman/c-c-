In C++, what's the difference between a declaration and a definition?

    A declaration introduces a name and its type to the program, while a definition provides the actual implementation or storage for that name.

What are header files used for?

    Header files declare functions, classes, and variables that can be shared between multiple source files, allowing code reusability and modularity.

When a compiler creates a program, in what part of the construction process does it use header files and in what part libraries?

    The compiler uses header files during the compilation phase to check for correct usage and definitions of functions and classes, while it uses libraries during the linking phase to resolve and bind function calls to their implementations.

Is a library an object module? Explain, and do not just answer yes or no.

    No, a library is a collection of object modules (object files) that are pre-compiled code, packaged together for reuse, while an object module is a single compiled source file containing machine code but not yet linked into an executable.

Why is an object file obtained after compiling a source containing int main() not an executable program?

    An object file is not an executable because it only contains machine code for the compiled source and lacks necessary linking of all required libraries and other object files needed to form a complete executable.
